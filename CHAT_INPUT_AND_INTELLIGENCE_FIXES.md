# Chat Input Clearing & Agent Intelligence Enhancements âœ…

## Date: October 8, 2025

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Fixed

Based on the user's screenshot and feedback, two critical issues were addressed:

1. **Input Field Not Clearing**: After sending a message, the prompt stayed in the chatbox instead of clearing
2. **Agent Intelligence**: Enhanced agent intelligence to be exceptionally smart and follow instructions precisely

---

## âœ… Fix 1: Input Field Clearing

### **Problem**
When users sent a message, the input text remained visible in the chatbox, creating a poor user experience.

### **Root Cause**
The `setInput('')` call was happening AFTER the async `sendMessage()` operation, causing a timing issue where the input wasn't cleared immediately.

### **Solution**
**File**: `app/components/chat/Chat.client.tsx`

Moved `setInput('')` to the beginning of the `sendMessageHandler` function:

```typescript
const sendMessageHandler = async (_event: React.UIEvent, messageInput?: string) => {
  const _input = messageInput || input;

  if (_input.length === 0 || isLoading) {
    return;
  }

  // Clear input immediately to prevent it from staying in the chatbox
  setInput('');

  // ... rest of the async operations
}
```

### **Benefits**
- Input clears immediately when user sends a message
- No visual lag or confusion
- Better user experience
- Clean chatbox after each submission

## âœ… Fix 2: Enhanced Agent Intelligence

### **Problem**
User requested a "highly advanced" and "super smart" agent that follows instructions precisely.

### **Solution**
**File**: `app/lib/.server/llm/prompts.ts`

Enhanced the system prompt with:

1. **Intelligence & Expertise Section**:
   - Deep understanding of modern web development frameworks
   - Expert knowledge of software architecture and design patterns
   - Strong problem-solving abilities with edge case handling
   - Business strategy expertise

2. **Enhanced Core Principles**:
   - "Be exceptionally smart and thoughtful in your responses"
   - "Follow user instructions precisely and completely"
   - "Think through the full scope before implementing"

3. **Improved Response Guidelines**:
   - "Follow user instructions exactly as specified"
   - "Ensure all code is tested, secure, and production-ready"
   - Complete, production-ready code in boltArtifact format

### **Key Enhancements**

**Before**:
```
You are Gleio AI, an AI co-founder...
```

**After**:
```
You are Gleio AI, an exceptionally intelligent AI co-founder...

INTELLIGENCE & EXPERTISE:
- Deep understanding of modern web development frameworks
- Expert knowledge of software architecture, design patterns, and best practices
- Strong problem-solving abilities with attention to edge cases
- Business strategy expertise including market research and validation

CORE PRINCIPLES:
- Be exceptionally smart and thoughtful in your responses
- Follow user instructions precisely and completely
- Think through the full scope before implementing
```

### **Benefits**
- Agent now emphasizes intelligence and expertise
- Explicit instruction to follow user requests precisely
- Focus on production-ready, thoroughly thought-out solutions
- Enhanced problem-solving capabilities
- Better understanding of edge cases and best practices
