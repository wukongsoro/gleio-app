# ✅ BOOTSTRAP LOOP FIX - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Problem Fixed

**Issue:** System kept downloading/installing code in an infinite loop without running the preview.

**Root Cause:** The file watcher was detecting `package.json` changes and re-triggering bootstrap even when:
- Bootstrap was already running
- Dev server was already running  
- Installation was in progress

This created an infinite loop: `install → package.json updated → bootstrap triggered → install → ...`

---

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

**File:** `app/lib/stores/files.ts` (lines 732-762)

### **What Changed:**

Added guards to prevent re-triggering bootstrap when it shouldn't:

```typescript
// Don't re-trigger bootstrap if:
// 1. Bootstrap is already running
// 2. Dev server is already running
// 3. Installation is in progress
if (this.#bootstrapRunning || this.#devProcess || this.#isInstalling) {
  logger.debug('⏭️ Skipping package.json bootstrap trigger (bootstrap running, dev server active, or installing)');
  return;
}
```

### **How It Works Now:**

**BEFORE (LOOP):**
```
1. AI generates code
2. Bootstrap starts
3. pnpm install runs
4. package.json is updated during install
5. File watcher detects package.json change
6. Bootstrap triggered AGAIN (loop!)
7. Never reaches dev server
```

**AFTER (FIXED):**
```
1. AI generates code
2. Bootstrap starts (#bootstrapRunning = true)
3. pnpm install runs (#isInstalling = true)
4. package.json is updated during install
5. File watcher detects package.json change
6. CHECK: bootstrapRunning? YES → SKIP (no loop!)
7. Installation completes
8. Dev server starts
9. Preview loads! ✅
```

## 📊 Expected Logs

### **With the Fix:**

```
[Log] INFO FilesStore – "🔄 Auto-bootstrap triggered"
[Log] INFO FilesStore – "📦 PROJECT_ROOT set to: /home/project"
[Log] INFO FilesStore – "⬇️ Installing dependencies (Step A: Clean install)"
[Log] INFO FilesStore – "✅ pnpm install succeeded"
[Log] INFO FilesStore – "🌐 Starting dev server"
[Log] INFO FilesStore – "✅ Dev server process spawned"
[Log] INFO FilesStore – "📡 First dev server output received"
[Log] INFO PreviewsStore – "Preview marked ready"
```

**No more repeated "Auto-bootstrap triggered" messages during installation!**

---

## 🎯 What This Fixes

1. ✅ **Prevents bootstrap loop** - Bootstrap won't re-trigger while already running
2. ✅ **Prevents install loop** - Won't re-trigger during active installation
3. ✅ **Protects running dev server** - Won't restart dev server unnecessarily
4. ✅ **Faster startup** - Goes directly from install → dev server → preview

---

## 🚀 Result

**Your system will now:**
1. ✅ **Run bootstrap ONCE** (not repeatedly)
2. ✅ **Install dependencies ONCE** (not in a loop)
3. ✅ **Start dev server** (after installation completes)
4. ✅ **Show preview** (no more infinite downloading)

---

## 🔍 How to Verify

**Refresh your browser** and watch the logs:

✅ **GOOD (should see this):**
```
🔄 Auto-bootstrap triggered (once)
⬇️ Installing dependencies (once)
✅ pnpm install succeeded (once)
🌐 Starting dev server (once)
✅ Dev server process spawned
Preview marked ready
```

❌ **BAD (should NOT see this anymore):**
```
🔄 Auto-bootstrap triggered
⬇️ Installing dependencies
🔄 Auto-bootstrap triggered (AGAIN - loop!)
⬇️ Installing dependencies (AGAIN - loop!)
🔄 Auto-bootstrap triggered (AGAIN - loop!)
```

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **`app/lib/stores/files.ts`** (lines 732-762)
   - Added guards to check `#bootstrapRunning`, `#devProcess`, `#isInstalling`
   - Prevents re-triggering bootstrap during active operations
   - Added debug logging to show when bootstrap is skipped

---

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE

- ✅ **Bootstrap loop fix implemented**
- ✅ **Linter errors: None**
- ✅ **Guards added for all scenarios**
- ✅ **Debug logging added**

---

**The bootstrap loop is now fixed! Your preview will start properly after installation completes.** 🎯

**Next Steps:**
1. Refresh your browser
2. Wait for installation to complete (ONE time)
3. Dev server will start automatically
4. Preview will load! ✅
