# Research Workbench Implementation Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive Deep Research system using Tongyi DeepResearch 30B A3B model via OpenRouter, featuring a transparent research workflow with planâ†’searchâ†’fetchâ†’judgeâ†’synthesizeâ†’reflect loop.

## Features Implemented

### 1. TypeScript Types (`app/types/research.ts`)
- `ResearchTask` - Main task container with all research data
- `SubQuestion` - Individual research questions from planning phase
- `Step` - Execution steps with timing and I/O tracking
- `EvidenceCard` - Source metadata with trust scoring
- `Claim` - Findings with citation support
- `Draft` - Structured report output

### 2. Research Orchestrator (`app/lib/.server/research/orchestrator.ts`)
**Orchestration Flow:**
1. **Plan** - Decompose goal into 4-7 sub-questions with coverage scoring
2. **Search** - Generate 3-5 diverse queries per sub-question
3. **Fetch** - Retrieve sources (currently simulated, ready for real APIs)
4. **Judge** - Score sources on authority, recency, independence, relevance
5. **Synthesize** - Generate claims with citations and structured draft
6. **Reflect** (Heavy mode) - Seek counter-evidence and reconcile conflicts

**Key Functions:**
- `orchestrateResearch()` - Main orchestration loop
- `executePlanningStep()` - Break down research goal
- `executeSearchStep()` - Generate search queries
- `executeFetchStep()` - Fetch sources (mock implementation)
- `executeJudgeStep()` - Score and rank evidence
- `executeSynthesizeStep()` - Generate claims and draft
- `executeReflectStep()` - Counter-evidence analysis

### 3. Storage Layer (`app/lib/.server/research/storage.ts`)
In-memory storage for research tasks (production-ready for database migration)

### 4. API Routes (`app/routes/api.research-v2.ts`)
- `POST /api/research-v2` - Start new research task
- `GET /api/research-v2/:id` - Get task status
- `GET /api/research-v2/:id/stream` - SSE streaming for live updates

**SSE Events:**
- `connected` - Initial connection
- `status` - Task status updates
- `complete` - Research finished

### 5. UI Components

#### `ResearchWorkbench` (`app/components/research/ResearchWorkbench.tsx`)
Main UI with 4 panes:
- **Plan** - Sub-questions with progress tracking
- **Sources** - Evidence cards with trust scores and filtering
- **Notes** - Annotation workspace (placeholder)
- **Report** - Executive summary, sections, FAQ, bibliography, limitations

**Features:**
- Live SSE updates during research
- Collapsible trace drawer showing execution steps
- Source filtering (all/high/medium/low trust)
- Export to PDF (via browser print)
- Download research pack as JSON

#### `TrustChip` (`app/components/research/TrustChip.tsx`)
Color-coded trust score indicator (green/yellow/red banding)

#### `CitationBadge` (`app/components/research/CitationBadge.tsx`)
Inline citation with hover tooltip showing:
- Source title and publisher
- Publication date
- Quoted passage
- Link to original source

#### `PrintStyles` (`app/components/research/PrintStyles.tsx`)
Print-optimized CSS for PDF export:
- Hides UI chrome
- Adds page numbers and headers
- Optimizes typography for printing
- Shows link URLs

### 6. Test Page (`app/routes/research-test.tsx`)
Standalone test interface with:
- Research goal input
- Quick/Heavy mode selector
- Step-by-step instructions
- Live workbench integration

### 7. System Prompt Enhancement (`app/lib/.server/llm/prompts.ts`)
Added `<research_mode>` section with:
- Output contract for structured responses
- Step-by-step behavior guidelines
- Citation requirements
- Quality guardrails

## Data Flow

```
User Input â†’ POST /api/research-v2
           â†“
     Create ResearchTask
           â†“
  Background Orchestration
           â†“
   SSE Updates (every 500ms)
           â†“
    UI Refreshes Live
           â†“
   Final Task (done/error)
```

## Export Capabilities

1. **PDF Export** - Browser print with optimized styling
2. **JSON Export** - Complete research pack with:
   - Plan and sub-questions
   - All execution steps with timing
   - Evidence cards with metadata
   - Claims with citations
   - Structured draft

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to `/research-test` route
2. Enter research goal (e.g., "What are the latest quantum computing breakthroughs in 2024?")
3. Select Quick (fast) or Heavy (counter-evidence) mode
4. Click "Start Deep Research"
5. Watch workbench populate in real-time:
   - Plan fills with sub-questions
   - Sources appear with trust scores
   - Trace shows execution steps
   - Report builds progressively
6. Test features:
   - Tab navigation (Plan/Sources/Notes/Report)
   - Source filtering by trust level
   - Citation hover tooltips
   - Trace drawer toggle
   - Export PDF (Ctrl/Cmd+P)
   - Download JSON pack

## Production Considerations

### Ready for Production:
- âœ… Type-safe throughout
- âœ… Error handling
- âœ… SSE streaming
- âœ… Responsive UI
- âœ… PDF export
- âœ… JSON persistence

### Needs Enhancement:
- ðŸ”„ Real search API integration (currently mocked)
- ðŸ”„ Database persistence (currently in-memory)
- ðŸ”„ Rate limiting and retry logic
- ðŸ”„ User authentication/authorization
- ðŸ”„ Notes and annotation features
- ðŸ”„ Domain diversity enforcement (40% rule)
- ðŸ”„ Advanced PDF generation (server-side with page numbers)

   - Add PDF/paper extraction
   - Implement content hashing for deduplication

3. **Database Migration:**
   - Replace in-memory storage with Supabase
   - Add task ownership and sharing
   - Enable task history and search

4. **Advanced Features:**
   - Notes and annotations
   - Claim verification workflow
   - Domain diversity enforcement
   - Custom search filters
   - Collaborative research

## Test Results

âœ… All existing tests pass
âœ… No linter errors in new code
âœ… TypeScript compilation successful
âœ… SSE streaming functional
âœ… PDF export works via browser print
âœ… JSON export includes full research pack

## Estimated Testing Time

- Basic flow: 2-3 minutes per research query
- Quick mode: ~15-30 seconds
- Heavy mode: ~30-60 seconds (includes reflection)
- UI interaction: Instant updates via SSE

The system is now ready for end-to-end testing!
