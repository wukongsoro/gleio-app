# ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED - Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS Auto-Fix

## 🎯 Your Error

```
Error: It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. 
The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS 
with PostCSS you'll need to install `@tailwindcss/postcss` and update your PostCSS configuration.
```

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### **Problem:**
The auto-fix was detecting the error and adding `@tailwindcss/postcss` to `package.json`, but it **wasn't actually running `pnpm install`** to install the package. The dev server restarted without the package, causing the same error to appear again.

### **Solution:**
Enhanced the auto-fix to **actually run `pnpm install @tailwindcss/postcss`** before restarting the dev server.

## ⚠️ About the Contextify Warning

The warning you're seeing:
```
[Warning] [Contextify] [WARNING] running source code in new context
```

**This is completely harmless and can be ignored.** It comes from WebContainer's internal V8 sandboxing mechanism. It's a deprecation notice from an internal dependency, not an error in your application.
